# Instagram Monitoring Tool

This project enables you to monitor the latest posts from specified Instagram accounts using a watcher account. It automatically fetches the three most recent posts from these accounts and analyzes both the captions and images using OpenAI's GPT-4o model. The analysis determines whether the posts relate to a user-defined topic of interest. For example, I used it to scrape details about conferences and seminars from organizational accounts, but itâ€™s versatile enough to track brand mentions, event updates, or content trends across various industries.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This tool is a comprehensive Instagram monitoring system designed to help users stay informed about events, conferences, and opportunities shared by accounts they follow. The project implements a sophisticated scraping and analysis pipeline that:

1. **Track Instagram Followings**: Automatically monitors Instagram accounts you follow and tracks changes over time
2. **Detect Events**: Uses AI-powered analysis to identify events from Instagram posts with high accuracy
3. **Dashboard Visualization**: Presents findings through an intuitive Next.js dashboard with real-time statistics
4. **Scheduled Processing**: Runs tasks on customizable schedules to maintain up-to-date information while avoiding Instagram detection
5. **Efficient Operation**: Implements robust caching to minimize API costs and improve performance

Perfect for professionals, researchers, or anyone who wants to keep track of activities and events within their network without constantly checking Instagram.

## Instagram Functionality

### Event Detection

Automatically detect conferences, seminars, and events from Instagram posts:

```bash
# Run event detection on all followings
npm run detect-events

# Run event detection on a limited number of accounts
npm run detect-events -- --max=5
```

The script will:
1. Fetch your Instagram followings from Supabase
2. Scrape recent posts from each account
3. Use OpenAI to analyze if posts are about events (with >90% confidence)
4. Store events in the Supabase `instagram_events` table
5. Save results to a local JSON file

#### Database Schema

To create the required tables in Supabase, run this SQL:

```sql
-- Watchlist table to store Instagram accounts and their followings
CREATE TABLE public.watchlist (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  account TEXT NOT NULL,
  followings TEXT[] NOT NULL,
  last_checked TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  
  CONSTRAINT unique_account UNIQUE(account)
);

-- Index for faster queries by account
CREATE INDEX idx_watchlist_account ON public.watchlist(account);

-- Historical data for tracking followings count changes over time
CREATE TABLE public.watchlist_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  account TEXT NOT NULL,
  followings_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Index for faster historical queries
CREATE INDEX idx_watchlist_history_account ON public.watchlist_history(account);
CREATE INDEX idx_watchlist_history_created_at ON public.watchlist_history(created_at);

-- Events table to store detected events from Instagram posts
CREATE TABLE public.instagram_events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  account TEXT NOT NULL,
  post_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  post_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  post_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  caption TEXT,
  image_url TEXT,
  is_event BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  event_type TEXT,
  event_details JSONB,
  confidence_score DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  
  CONSTRAINT unique_post UNIQUE(post_id)
);

-- Index for faster queries by account
CREATE INDEX idx_instagram_events_account ON public.instagram_events(account);

-- Index for confidence score filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_instagram_events_confidence ON public.instagram_events(confidence_score);

-- Index for event type filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_instagram_events_event_type ON public.instagram_events(event_type);
```

### Caching System

This project implements an in-memory caching system to reduce database queries, API calls, and improve performance.

#### Benefits

- **Reduced API Costs**: Prevents redundant OpenAI API calls for already analyzed posts
- **Improved Performance**: Eliminates repeated database queries for frequently accessed data
- **Rate Limit Protection**: Helps stay below API rate limits by reducing request volume

#### Cache TTL Settings

| Data Type            | TTL (Time-to-Live) | Rationale                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Instagram Followings | 3h 55m             | Expires 5 minutes before next follower check |
| Followings Statistics| 1h 55m             | Expires 5 minutes before next post check    |
| Historical Data      | 3h 55m             | Expires 5 minutes before next follower check |
| OpenAI Post Analysis | 7 days             | Post content doesn't change after posting   |

#### How Caching Works

1. **On First Request**: 
   - The system checks the cache for requested data
   - If not found, it fetches from the database or external API
   - The result is stored in cache with an appropriate TTL

2. **On Subsequent Requests**:
   - Data is retrieved directly from cache if available and not expired
   - Cache hits are logged for monitoring effectiveness

3. **For OpenAI Analysis**:
   - Before sending a post to OpenAI, the system checks:
     1. If the post is already in the database (database check)
     2. If the post has already been analyzed (cache check)
   - Only new, never-analyzed posts are sent to the OpenAI API

#### Cache Keys

- Followings: `followings:{account_name}`
- Statistics: `followings_stats:{account_name}`
- Historical data: `followings_history:{account_name}:{date}`
- OpenAI analysis: `post_analysis:{post_id}`

This caching system significantly reduces operating costs and improves performance in production environments.

### Retrieving Followings List

To retrieve your Instagram followings list and store them in Supabase:

```bash
# Retrieve all followings
npm run followings

# Retrieve a limited number of followings
npm run followings -- --max=20
```

The script will:
- Log in to your Instagram account
- Fetch the list of users you're following
- Store the followings in your Supabase database in the `watchlist` table
- Display statistics about your followings
- Save the complete list to a timestamped JSON file

### Supabase Database Structure

The basic followings are stored in the Supabase `watchlist` table with the following structure:

| Column        | Type          | Description                                  |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| account       | text          | The Instagram account username (e.g., "majascrap") |
| followings    | array of text | Array of usernames that the account follows  |
| last_checked  | timestamp     | When the followings list was last updated    |

### Full Post Fetching (Optional)

For more comprehensive data collection including post content:

```bash
# Basic post fetching
npm run instagram

# Advanced post fetching with parameters
npm run instagram-fetch -- --max-users=10 --posts-per-user=3
```
